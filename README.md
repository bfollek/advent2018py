Advent of Code 2018 in python

#### Status

* Day 1 - Done. Typed.

* Day 2 - Done. Typed.

* Day 3 - Done. Typed.

* Day 4 - Done. Typed.

* Day 5 - Done.

* Day 6 - Done. Woohoo!

* Day 7 - Done.

To run it, you'll need [simple_graph](https://github.com/bfollek/simple_graph) on your PYTHONPATH.

* Day 8 - Done.

* Day 9 - Done.

To run it, you'll need [cdll](https://github.com/bfollek/cdll) on your PYTHONPATH.

I took a tip from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a4j11i/2018_day_9_part_2_strategy_help/) and switched my array to a circular doubly linked list. The cdll was two orders of magnitude faster on part2.

* Day 10 - Not yet.

* Day 11 - Done. Typed.

My first pass at part2 ran for several minutes without finishing. So I took a dive into numpy. Its array type was much faster, fast enough to get me a result in under two minutes. I'm surprised and pleased to be leveraging Fortran in 2019.
