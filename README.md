* Day 7 - done. To run it, you'll need [simple_graph](https://github.com/bfollek/simple_graph) on your PYTHONPATH.

* Day 8 - done.

* Day 9 - done. To run it, you'll need [cdll](https://github.com/bfollek/cdll) on your PYTHONPATH. I took a tip from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a4j11i/2018_day_9_part_2_strategy_help/) and switched my array to a circular doubly linked list. The cdll was two orders of magnitude faster on part2.

* Day 10 - not yet.

* Day 11 - part1 done. Typed.
